This webpage uses AJAX calls to the Giphy API to implement a rudimentary gif search.
Users are presented with pre-made buttons of 90's cartoon characters. Clicking on a button will show 10 gifs related to the cartoon character listed as the buttons' text.
The user is also able to use the search field to do a custom search for a gif. Clicking the search button will add a button with their input text next to the pre-made buttons. Clicking on this button will show 10 gifs related to the user's search term.
